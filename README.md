# NodeDSF
NodeDSF is a project which includes a set of custom Nodes (called dsfnode) for Node-red to interface with Duet Software Framework on SBC, plus an optional DWC Plugin which allows you to embedd your custom GUI's within the Duet web interface

### New Duet Mode : Now works with Duet Control boards (v2/3) running firmware v3+ directly (experimental) + DSF on SBC's.  

Below is a brief overview video showcasing some of what can be achieved with NodeDSF.
